=====

Initially released at May 13, 2015 (according to [Wikipedia][])

It started as VoIP and text chat application for video gaming community.
For the rest, see the [Wikipedia]
By the way, VoIP is a short term of "Voice over Internet Protocol".

Unlike slack, discord has no limit for it's message history.

Integrations
----

Although discord has integrations like slack, it has less option for outgoing request.
Bot is the only way to pass some output to outer network.

For webhook, only incoming webhook is allowed and there is no outgoing webhook settings, as far as I know.
Also you cannot make a custom command, the one starts with `/`.
